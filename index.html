        <h1>Information about Einstein</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Born: 14 March 1879</li>
          <li>Died: 18 April 1955 (aged 76)</li>
          <li>
            He was a theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of
            the greatest physicists of all time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Einstein is known widely for developing the theory of relativity,
            but he also made important contributions to the development of the
            theory of quantum mechanics.
          </li>
          <li>
            His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from
            relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous
            equation".
          </li>
          <li>
            His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
            science.
          </li>
          <li>
            He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to
            theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law
            of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of
            quantum theory.
          </li>
          <li>
            His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in
            "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".
          </li>
